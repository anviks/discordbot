## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- gettext: This package includes the `msgfmt` tool, which is used for compiling `.po` files into `.mo` files for
  translations. To install it:
    - Windows: `winget install GnuWin32.gettext`
    - Linux: `sudo apt-get install gettext`
    - MacOS: `brew install gettext`
- Libraries from `requirements.txt`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/anviks/discordbot.git
    cd discordbot
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional):
    - Windows:
        ```powershell
        py -m venv .venv
        .venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    - Linux/MacOS:
        ```shell
        python3 -m venv .venv
        source .venv/bin/activate
        ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Provide the necessary environment variables:
   For that create at least one of the following files in the root directory:
    - `.env.development` (for development)
    - `.env.production` (for production)

   Bot run scripts will automatically copy the content of the appropriate file to the `.env` file.

   Add the following environment variables to the file:
    ```dotenv
    DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
    DEFAULT_CHANNEL_ID=your_default_channel_id
    SQLITE_DB_PATH=your_sqlite_db_path
    ```

5. Create a `.sqlite` database file by any means and provide the path to the database file in the `SQLITE_DB_PATH`
   environment variable. After that, run the table creation script in `scripts/init_db.sql` to create the necessary
   table(s).

6. Run the bot by executing:
    - `scripts\run.ps1 dev` for development (Windows)
    - `scripts\run.ps1 prod` for production (Windows)
    - `scripts/run.sh dev` for development (Linux/MacOS)
    - `scripts/run.sh prod` for production (Linux/MacOS)
